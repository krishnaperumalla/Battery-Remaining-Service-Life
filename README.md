# Battery-Remaining-Service-Life
This repository presents a machine learning–based approach to predict the Remaining Service Life (RSL) of lithium-ion batteries using real operational data from NMC–LCO 18650 cells. Accurate RSL prediction is critical for improving the efficiency, reliability, and safety of electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems.
